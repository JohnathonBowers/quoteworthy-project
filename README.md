# Quoteworthy

The Quoteworthy app allows users to add and manage important quotations they encounter while reading books. Quotation entries require citation information (book title, publisher info, page number[s]), both to help users remember where the quotation came from and be able to provide this information if they choose to use these quotations in an academic setting.
